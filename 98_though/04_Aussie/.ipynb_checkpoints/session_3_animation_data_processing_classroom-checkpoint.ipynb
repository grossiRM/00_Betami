    "Matplotlib has options to create 3D plots, albeit not as sophisticated as mayavi and paraview. It is still very useful for plotting relatively simple 3D graphs, such as flow paths calculated by a groundwater model. In the first example of this session, we will import the data from a pathline output file created by MODPATH. This could be handled using `numpy`'s `genfromtxt` function, but to make life a little easier, we will use the `flopy` library because it has a built-in function that will decipher the file structure automatically. Before continuing, you may want to view the contents of the file. As you can infer from its structure, there are 17 pathlines, each visualising the path of the groundwater to one of the 17 screens of two multi-level observation wells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can do anything, we have to import the packages that we will be using during this session. In order to use the 3D plotting functions of `matplotlib` we have to import from `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` as well."

Because `flopy` already did the hard work of reading the file, the plotting of the pathlines is not all that hard. We loop over all the pathline ids, get the x, y and z coordinates that define the line and provide the `plot` command to draw them.

The `imread` function can be used to import bitmap images (in 'normal' 2D images, you can plot them using `imshow`). It is used here to open a png file that was created in QGIS. It contains OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for a specified region of which the corner coordinates are known. The values of the pixels in the image are used to define the facecolors of a `surface plot`. The plotted surface has as many cells as there are pixels in the image and is plotted at a fixed elevation. Note how the `alpha` keyworde is used to define the transparency of the bitmap."

    "Instead of using the mouse, the camera viewpoint of the 3D figure can also be changed using `ax.view_init(elev=x, azim=y)` where `x` and `y` are some number. You can create a `for` loop in which `x` or `y` (or both) gradually change. By calling the `plt.savefig` function after each update of the figure, a sequence of bitmap images can be saved, which can be stitched together to create a avi movie file. This is how the animation shown during the webinar prior to this course was created.
