# ## Colloid Filtration Theory
# Let's define a function to calculate the diffusion, interception, and sedimentation collector contact efficiency. These are equations 6-8 in [Yao et al, 1971](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es60058a005).

    # collector efficiency 
    # diffusion single collector efficiency (Equation 6 from Yao 1971)
    eta_d = 0.9*(k*T/(mu*dp*d*v))**(2/3) # a good check of this equation is to calculate the units
    # interception single collector efficiency (Equation 7 from Yao 1971)
    eta_i = (3/2)*(dp/d)**2
    # sedimentation single collector efficiency (Equation 8 from Yao 1971)
    eta_g = (rho_p - rho_w)*g*dp**2/ (18*mu*v)
    
    return eta_d, eta_i, eta_g


# Now lets see if we can recreate Figure 3 from [Yao et al, 1971](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es60058a005).

# ### Deposition rate coefficients
# 
# This mechanistic description of colloid filtration on a single sand grain (also termed collector) can be extended to a porous media through the definition of a deposition rate coefficient (usually expressed in notes/literature as $k_d$, $k_f$, or $k_c$). This deposition rate coefficient can then be incorporated into previous analytical solutions that we explored in the reactive contaminants module (the ```mu``` variable in the analytical solutions).

# In[6]:


# Equation 5 in Li et al 2004 (10.1021/es049154v) or Equation 20 in Tufenkji and Elimelech, 2004 (10.1021/es034049r)
# alpha is the attachment efficiency
# phi is the porosity 
def kc_calc(d, v, alpha, phi, eta):
    kc = 3/2*(1-phi)*v*alpha*eta/d
    return kc


# In[7]:


# alpha is the attachment efficiency
alpha = 1 # for now assume fully favorable conditions (every particle that hits a grain of sand sticks)
# phi is the porosity 
phi = 0.3 # porosity of a typical sand pack
# let's define a single colloid size
dp = 10* 1e-6 # meters
# and recalculate eta for this single value of dp
eta_d, eta_i, eta_g = eta_calc(dp, d, v, rho_p)
eta = eta_d + eta_i + eta_g

kc = kc_calc(d, v, alpha, phi, eta)
print('Deposition rate coefficient = ' + str(kc))


# ##### What are the units of this deposition rate coefficient? Does this agree with the units that we had for first order reaction terms?

# ### Analytical solution: Type 1 boundary conditions with first order reaction
# 
# Remember back to our [First Order Reactions notebook](https://github.com/zahasky/Contaminant-Hydrogeology-Activities/blob/master/First%20Order%20Reactions.ipynb) were we described the analytical solution to the ADE with following function. Note that here we are not interested in zero order production or retardation so the function has been simplified to remove ```gamma```.

        C_out = Ci*Atrf + C0*Btrf - C0*Bttrf
        
    else: # if a continous injection then ignore the Bttrf term (no superposition)
        C_out = Ci*Atrf + C0*Btrf
        
    
    # Return the concentration (C) from this function

# ## Activity: Calculated deposition rate coefficient from the breakthrough curves
# Now image that you measured the ```C_solute``` and ```C_particles``` (that are plotted in the previous cell) in lab. Based on this data, calculate the desposition rate coefficient. The equation to do this is in the slides and given by: 
# 
# $C/C_0 = \text{exp}(-k_c L/v)$
# 
# You will need to rearrange this equation to solve for $k_c$.

# In[10]:


# start by indexing the last value measured in C_particles. 
# C_div_C0 = ...

# print(C_div_C0)


# In[25]:


# Uncomment this based on the rearranged equation you wrote out in the first cell.
kc_btc = -np.log(C_particles[-1]/1)*v/x

print('Deposition rate coefficient calculated from btc = ' + str(kc_btc))
print('Analytical model deposition rate coefficient input = ' + str(kc))


# How does the $k_c$ value input into the analytical solution compare with the value calculated from the breakthrough curves? 

# ## Bonus: Explore a more complicated temporal moment analysis when we are dealing with finite pulses or plumes of solutes experience first order reactions
# 
# A natural next question is how to calculate the deposition rate coefficient if we have a pulse of solute rather than continous injection/source. Let's start be using our same functions that we defined above but now with a finite pulse.

# In[16]:


# dispersion
D = 0.03*v
pulse_time = 60 # seconds
# initial concentration
C0 = 1

# conservative solute (notice that we set mu=0)
C_solute_pulse = ADEwReactions_type1_fun(x, t, v, D, 0, C0, pulse_time, 0)
# particles solute (notice that we set mu=kf)
C_particles_pulse = ADEwReactions_type1_fun(x, t, v, D, kc, C0, pulse_time, 0)
plt.plot(t/60, C_solute_pulse, label = 'conservative solute pulse')
plt.plot(t/60, C_particles_pulse, label = 'colloid pulse')
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('Time (minutes)')
plt.show()


# To calculate the deposition rate coeffient we will use the method of the temporal moments as described in detail in [Pang et al, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016977220200061X) and references therein.

# In[13]:


# remember from moment analysis that we have
# zero temporal moment
M0 = np.trapz(C_particles_pulse, t)

# Pang et al 2003 Equation 10
kc_btc_pulse = (v**2/(4*D))*((1- (2*D/(x*v))*np.log(M0/(C0*pulse_time)))**2 -1)

# Print the output and compare it with our model input!!
print('Deposition rate coefficient calculated from btc = ' + str(kc_btc_pulse))
print('Analytical model deposition rate coefficient input = ' + str(kc))


# How does it look?!
