# MT3DMS Example Problems

The purpose of this notebook is to recreate the example problems that are described in the 1999 MT3DMS report.

There are 10 example problems:
1. One-Dimensional Transport in a Uniform Flow Field
2. One-Dimensional Transport with Nonlinear or Nonequilibrium Sorption
3. Two-Dimensional Transport in a Uniform Flow Field
4. Two-Dimensional Transport in a Diagonal Flow Field
5. Two-Dimensional Transport in a Radial Flow Field
6. Concentration at an Injection/Extraction Well
7. Three-Dimensional Transport in a Uniform Flow Field
8. Two-Dimensional, Vertical Transport in a Heterogeneous Aquifer
9. Two-Dimensional Application Example
10. Three-Dimensional Field Case Study
