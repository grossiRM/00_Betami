    "**Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity methods we've looked at so far only evaluate the \"local\" sensitivity at a single set of parameter values.  For example, the Jacobian matrix represents perturbations to a single set of parameter values.  This local view can be a problem in cases when our inverse problem is nonlinear, which means the parameter sensitivities can change depending on what the parameter value is. In contrast, Global Sensitivity Analyses are statistical approaches that characterize how model parameters affect model outputs over a __wide range__ of acceptable parameter values. Because we often test a number of parameter sets during parameter estimation, GSA methods provide a more robust view of parameter sensitivity compared to traditional, derivative-based local sensitivity analysis. Some GSA methods provide general information about the variability of the sensitivities and have relatively low computational requirements, whereas others provide detailed information on nonlinear behavior and interactions between parameters at the expense of larger computational requirements. For a complete introduction to GSA theory and methods, see Saltelli and others (2004, 2008)."

    "GSA++ is a stand-alone program distributed with the PEST++ Version 3 suite of tools that perform GSA. It leverages the PEST++ parallel run manger YAMR, and is fully compatible with PEST/PEST++ file formats, including template and instruction files. For us this means we can access the insight of GSA using parallel computing without changing our files. More GSA++ running details are provided in appendix 6 of the PEST++ V3 Techniques and Methods Report. Appendixes 7 and 8 demonstrate the use of GSA++ for a Method of Morris and Sobol example problem.  In this notebook we'll run GSA on the Freyburg model."

    "\n",
    "The program GSA++ currently supports two GSA methods: (1) the __Method of Morris__ (Morris, 1991), and (2) the __Method of Sobol__ (Sobol, 2001). In the class we'll focus on the Method of Morris because it is computationally more efficient. But this efficiency comes with a tradeoff: the Method of Morris only provides estimates of the mean and variance of the sensitivity distribution for each parameter. Because of the lack of complete description of the parameter nonlinearity and interactions between parameters, the Method of Morris can be used as a screening-level tool to identify the most important parameters for the observations tested. This screening can be followed by application of a more comprehensive tool, such as the Method of Sobol, which further characterizes the effects of parameter nonlinearity and inter-parameter interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Method of Morris is referred to as a “one-at-a-time” method because each parameter is perturbed sequentially to compute sensitivities, which is ideally suited for parallel computing. The method samples the sensitivity of a given parameter at several locations over the range of reasonable parameter space (__defined by the parameter bounds in the PEST Control file__) and then provides two measures of parameter sensitivity: the mean (__μ__) and the standard deviation (__σ__) of the resulting sensitivity distribution. The mean, __μ__, captures the overall effect of a parameter on the model output of interest; the standard deviation, __σ__, measures a parameter’s sensitivity across the range of acceptable parameter values, this being an indicator of how nonlinear a given parameter is and (or) how the parameter interacts with other parameters. It is important to note that the Method of Morris __cannot distinguish__ between parameter nonlinearity and parameter interactions because only the standard deviation of parameter sensitivity is available. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### For the class we'll focus on the easiest way to get in the GSA game using pyemu, but this is also likely what you would start with in 95% of the models you evaluate.  For convenience, widely applicable default values are supplied for you by pyemu but can easily be changed by editing the *.gsa* file pyemu creates  (see Appendix 6 in the PEST++ V3 report for descriptions of the *.gsa* variables). \n",
