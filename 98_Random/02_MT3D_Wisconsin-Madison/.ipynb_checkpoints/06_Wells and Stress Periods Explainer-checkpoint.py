# ## Introduction
# Often times we will want to create more complex boundary conditions, such as those with a changing source concentration with time, or a source that is not at the edge of a model. This can get a little complicated so this notebook demonstrates how to set up these sources as 'wells' and how to edit the Modflow-MT3D stress periods accordingly. 
# 
# If you haven't installed Flopy, go back to the [MODFLOW and FloPy setup notebook](https://github.com/zahasky/Contaminant-Hydrogeology-Activities/blob/master/MODFLOW%2C%20Python%2C%20and%20FloPy%20Setup.ipynb) and the [FloPy Introduction notebook](https://github.com/zahasky/Contaminant-Hydrogeology-Activities/blob/master/FloPy%20Introduction.ipynb).
# 
# Import the standard libraries, plus a one we haven't seen ([deepcopy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#copy.deepcopy)).

# In[ ]:


# Import the flopy library
import flopy
# Import a few additional libraries

# In addition to our typical libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from copy import deepcopy as deepcopy


# First find where you have your MODFLOW and MT3D executables located on your system.

# In[ ]:


# Path to MODFLOW executable, probably called 'mf2005'
exe_name_mf = 'C:\\Hydro\\MF2005.1_12\\bin\\mf2005.exe'
# Print to make sure it is formated correctly
print(exe_name_mf)
# Path to MT3D-USGS executable, probably called 'mt3dms'
exe_name_mt = 'C:\\Hydro\\mt3dusgs1.1.0\\bin\\mt3d-usgs_1.1.0_64.exe'
# Print to make sure it is formated correctly
print(exe_name_mt)


# Let's use the same directory to save the data as the FloPy introduction and then create a path to this workspace. It may be useful to understand your current working directory, this should be whereever you have this notebook saved. You can double check this with the command 'os.getcwd()'.

# In[ ]:


# This should return a path to your current working directory
current_directory = os.getcwd()
print(current_directory)


# In[ ]:


# if this is not where you want to save stuff then change your directory using 'os.chdir()'
# define path
path = pathlib.Path('C:\\Users\\zahas\\Dropbox\\Teaching\\Contaminant hydro 629\\Notebooks_unpublished')
# if folder doesn't exist then make it 
path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
# set working directory to this new folder

workdir = os.path.join('.', directory_name)


# As usual, 'dirname' will be an input to our model function.

# ### 2D plot function
# Before jumping into the model, lets define a function for easily generating 2D plots. This will help us visualize what is happening as we build our model.

# In[ ]:


def plot_2d(map_data, dx, dy, colorbar_label, cmap):
    # shape information
    r, c = np.shape(map_data)
    # define plot coordinates
    x_coord = np.linspace(0, dx*c, c+1)
    y_coord = np.linspace(0, dy*r, r+1)
    
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x_coord, y_coord)

    plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4), dpi=120)
    plt.pcolormesh(X, Y, map_data, cmap=cmap, shading = 'auto', edgecolor ='k', linewidth = 0.05)

    # add a colorbar
    cbar = plt.colorbar() 
    # plt.clim(cmin, cmax)

    plt.show()


# ## Well Demo Function
# So far when we have built models we have not messed around to much with things like the source concentration, timing, and location but this is often the first step in building more complex and site-specific models. Here we will first set up a function that pulls out these model inputs so that we can more carefully explore what is happening.
# 
# The first thing we do is setup the function. We will use nearly identical settings as we used in the [FloPy Introduction notebook](https://github.com/zahasky/Contaminant-Hydrogeology-Activities/blob/master/FloPy%20Introduction.ipynb) example, but now we are providing a few input variables that can be changed everytime we call the model. The input variables are:
# 
# ### Function Input:
# #### directory name
#     direname = 
# 
# #### period length 
# Time is in selected units, the model time length is the sum of this (for steady state flow it can be set to anything). The format for multi-period input: ```[60., 15*60]```
#  
#     perlen_mf = 
#     
# #### advection velocity
# Note that this is only an approximate advection flow rate in due to the way that the inlet boundary conditions are being assigned in the MODFLOW BAS6 - Basic Package. More rigorous constraint of constant flux boundaries require the Flow and Head Boundary Package, the Well Package, or the Recharge Package.
# 
#     v = 
#     
# #### dispersivity
# Set the longitudinal dispersivity in selected units. What are the units again?
# 
#     al = 
#     
# #### itype
# An integer indicating the type of solute source condition. ```itype = -1``` corresponds to a constant concentration boundary (first-type boundary conditions in our analytical solutions) and ```itype = 1``` is equivalent to third type boundary conditions in our analytical solution.  
# 
#     itype = 
#

# ### Define flow wells

# In[ ]:

# Stress period well data for MODFLOW. Each well is defined through defintition
