    "# \n",
    "# The purpose of this exercise is to introduce the basics of using Flopy to construct, run and visualize a MODFLOW 6 model and its outputs. It is assumed you are familiar with MODFLOW 6.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# We will cover the following:\n",
    "#  - creating a Simulation Object\n",
    "#  - creating a Model Object\n",
    "#  - defining time and spatial discretisation\n",
    "#  - adding Packages\n",
    "#  - writting the MODFLOW files and running the model\n",
    "#  - post-processing some results\n",
    "# \n",
    "# This exercise is based on a simple groundwater system composed of two aquifer layers, separated by a thin low-permeability layer. A river flows across the center of the system in a straight line (not very natural, I know, but it keeps things simple for the tutorial), from West to East (left to right). The river only intersects the upper aquifer layer. The upper layer also receives recharge from rainfall.\n",

    "# This exercise addresses how to deal with data variables for MODFLOW 6 objects in FloPy. \n",
    "# FloPy handles MODFLOW 6 model data in a diffferent manner from other MODFLOW model variants. \n",
    "# \n",
    "# FloPy stores MODFLOW 6 model data in data objects. These data objects are accesible via simulation or model packages. \n",
    "# Data can be added to a package during construction or at a later stage through package attributes.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# There are three (at the time of writting) types of model data objects:\n",
    "#  - MFDataScalar\n",
    "#  - MFDataArray\n",
    "#  - MFDataList\n",
    "# \n",
    "# The current exercise will focus on List Data (MFDataList objects).\n",
    "# \n",
    "# ## List Data\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Some MODFLOW 6 data can conveniently be stored in tabular format, such as in a numpy recarray or pandas dataframe. These data are stored by FloPy in MFList or MFTransientList objects. \n",
    "# \n",
    "# MFList data can contain a single or multiple rows. Each column of the list contains the same data type. Single row MFLists usualy pertain to pacakge options (such as the BUY pacakge's pacakgedata). Multiple row MFLists are used for things like the 'conectiondata' for the MAW or Lake packages.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Perhaps most used are MFTransientList data, in which FloPy stores lists of stress period data. These are often used to assign stress package values at specifc cells and stress periods (i.e. pumping rates in the WEL package). \n",
    "# \n",
    "# In the following exercise we will adapt the model from excerise 01 by adding two new stress periods. We will then place a well in the lower aquifer using the WEL package. Diferent pumping rates will be assigned to each stress period to demosntrate the use of MFTranslientList data.\n",
