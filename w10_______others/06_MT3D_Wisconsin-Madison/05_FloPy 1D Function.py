# ## Introduction
# This is an introduction to using FloPy within a model-specific function. If you haven't installed Flopy, go back to the [MODFLOW and FloPy setup notebook](https://github.com/zahasky/Contaminant-Hydrogeology-Activities/blob/master/MODFLOW%2C%20Python%2C%20and%20FloPy%20Setup.ipynb) and the [FloPy Introduction notebook](https://github.com/zahasky/Contaminant-Hydrogeology-Activities/blob/master/FloPy%20Introduction.ipynb).
# 
# Import the standard libraries

# In[1]:


# Import a few libraries
import sys
import os
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pathlib
# Import the flopy library
import flopy
'flopy' in sys.modules #True


# First find where you have your MODFLOW and MT3D executables located on your system.

# In[2]:


# Path to MODFLOW executable, probably called 'mf2005'
exe_name_mf = 'C:\\Hydro\\MF2005.1_12\\bin\\mf2005.exe'
# Print to make sure it is formated correctly
print(exe_name_mf)
# Path to MT3D-USGS executable, probably called 'mt3dms'
exe_name_mt = 'C:\\Hydro\\mt3dusgs1.1.0\\bin\\mt3d-usgs_1.1.0_64.exe'
# Print to make sure it is formated correctly
print(exe_name_mt)


# Let's use the same directory to save the data as the FloPy introduction and then create a path to this workspace. It may be useful to understand your current working directory, this should be whereever you have this notebook saved. You can double check this with the command 'os.getcwd()'.

# In[3]:


# This should return a path to your current working directory
current_directory = os.getcwd()
print(current_directory)


# In[4]:


# if this is not where you want to save stuff then make a new folder and set this to be the new working directory
# define path
path = pathlib.Path('C:\\Users\\zahas\\Dropbox\\Teaching\\Contaminant hydro 629\\Notebooks_unpublished')
# if folder doesn't exist then make it 
path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
# set working directory to this new folder
os.chdir(path)
current_directory = os.getcwd()
print(current_directory)


# In[5]:


# directory to save data
directory_name = 'data_1D_model'
# directory to save data
datadir = os.path.join('..', directory_name, 'mt3d_test', 'mt3dms')
workdir = os.path.join('.', directory_name)


# Notice however that we don't yet name the folder where we will save data 'dirname'. This will be an input to our model function.
# 
# 
# ## 1D Model Function
# The first thing we do is setup the function. We will use nearly identical settings as we used in the [FloPy Introduction notebook](https://github.com/zahasky/Contaminant-Hydrogeology-Activities/blob/master/FloPy%20Introduction.ipynb) example, but now we are providing a few input variables that can be changed everytime we call the model. The input variables are:
# 
# ### Function Input:
# #### directory name
#     direname = 
# 
# #### period length 
# Time is in selected units, the model time length is the sum of this (for steady state flow it can be set to anything). The format for multi-period input: ```[60., 15*60]```
#  
#     perlen_mf = 
#     
# #### advection velocity
# Note that this is only an approximate advection flow rate in due to the way that the inlet boundary conditions are being assigned in the MODFLOW BAS6 - Basic Package. More rigorous constraint of constant flux boundaries require the Flow and Head Boundary Package, the Well Package, or the Recharge Package.
# 
#     v = 
#     
# #### dispersivity
# Set the longitudinal dispersivity in selected units. What are the units again?
# 
#     al = 
#     
# #### itype
# An integer indicating the type of solute source condition. ```itype = -1``` corresponds to a constant concentration boundary (first-type boundary conditions in our analytical solutions) and ```itype = 1``` is equivalent to third type boundary conditions in our analytical solution.  
# 
#     itype = 
#

# #### Work through the following questions:
# Explain the differences between these concentration profiles at different times. 
# 
# What is the mechanism that leads to differences in solute front location? For example, if time and spatial location don't change, what will cause the green line to shift left or shift right along the x-axis?
# 
# How is the slope of the line changing at the two differnt times. Does the slope increase or decrease with time? Why?
# 
# Why does the FloPy model fit a Type 1 inlet boundary condition and not a Type 3 (hint go back and examine our ```itype``` input variable)? Do the differences between the two solutions increase or decrease with changes in dispersivity?
